The actress Toni Collette remarked in an interview that director Ari Aster was **the most prepared director she had ever worked with**. Aster had visualized the entire movie _Hereditary_ in his mind, down to the smallest detail, two years before filming began.

The first time I encountered this concept was with another legendary director, Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock meticulously visualized scenes, shots, lighting, sets, and design to such an extent that filming became a mere technical execution of his preplanned vision.

## Why is this important

Being prepared can save valuable time and resources. Like narrowing the aperture of a camera: you focus on what truly matters while filtering out the unnecessary.

When you have the entire project visualized in your head, you can:

- **Schedule tasks**: Both micro and macro planning becomes precise and efficient.
- **Hire and manage people effectively**: You know exactly what skills to look for.
- **Calculate the budget accurately**: Early planning allows for cost savings, such as buying resources upfront.
- **Communicate clearly with your team**: Clarity leads to better teamwork and execution.
- **Build investor confidence**: A well-detailed project presentation increases the likelihood of funding or job approvals.
- **Anticipate failures**: Predicting potential issues helps mitigate risks.

In contrast, uncertainty and indecision lead to delays, wasted resources, poor management, and inconsistencies. Without a clear endpoint in mind, how would you even know when your project is complete?

## Keys To Remember

Setting clear goals and planning every attribute of a process drastically increases the likelihood of success compared to proceeding without a plan.

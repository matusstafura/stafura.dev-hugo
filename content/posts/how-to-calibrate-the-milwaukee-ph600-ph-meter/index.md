I recently purchased a Milwaukee pH600 pH meter for my microgreens project, and I want to share a quick and easy guide on how to calibrate it. Proper calibration ensures accurate readings, which are crucial for the health and growth of your microgreens.

What you'll need:

- Milwaukee pH600
- Calibration solution MA9007

### Calibration Steps:

1. Turn on the pH meter by switching the ON/OFF button.
2. Remove the protective cap.
3. Immerse the electrode in the pH 7.01 calibration solution (MA9007) and wait for the reading to stabilize.

In my case, the meter initially displayed 6.9.

4. Adjust the trimmer on the back of the device using a screwdriver until the display shows "7.0".

And that’s it! Your pH meter is now calibrated and ready to use.

### Tips for maintaining your pH meter

- Calibrate your pH meter regularly to ensure accurate readings.
- Always store the electrode in the protective cap with a few drops of storage solution (MA9015).
- Never use distilled or deionized water for calibration, as it can damage the electrode!

### Solutions for maintenance

There are 2 more solutions you will need for maintanance.

- Storage solution MA9015
- Cleaning solution MA9016

### Storing the electrode

Proper storage is essential to prolong the life of your pH meter. Follow these steps:

- Use MA9015 storage solution or pH 4.01 calibration solution (M10004).
- Pour a few drops into the protective cap.
- Replace the protective cap securely over the electrode.

### Cleaning

At least once per month clean the electrode with recommended solution MA9016 for 30 minutes.

### Logging

For consistent tracking, I created a template to log the calibration and usage of my pH600. Having a record helps me monitor the meter’s performance and ensure everything stays on track.

Finally, I found the time to set up my first homelab. To get hands-on experience with advanced Linux topics, virtualization, and Kubernetes, I needed a dedicated server. The truth is, you donâ€™t need anything fancyâ€”an old laptop can work just fine. I opted for a mini version since I might need to carry it to different locations.

### Specs

Let me introduce the HP EliteDesk 800 i5-6500T. It's second-hand but in excellent condition.

- i5-6500T - 3.10 GHz (4 Cores, 4 Threads)
- 16GB RAM
- 2.5" 256GB SSD
- M.2 500GB (an extra space I bought)
- no WiFi, LAN only

### Why

Until now, Iâ€™ve relied on either local computers or the cloud. While both have their advantages, they also come with significant costs, occasional lags, and the risk of corrupting local systems. With a homelab, I donâ€™t have to worry about any of that. I can experiment freely without limitations.

This setup gives me the freedom to dive into anything I need to master Linux, Kubernetes, or any new technology. For now, I find 16GB of RAM and 3.10 GHz sufficient for my needs.

### OS

At the moment, Iâ€™m using Ubuntu because Iâ€™m preparing for the LFCS exam. However, I plan to explore different distributions later to learn about their differences (e.g., Tuxedo OS, Arch Linux, Fedora, Gentoo, Void, and more).

Let's learn. ðŸš€

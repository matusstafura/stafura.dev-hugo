Have you ever felt tired or unmotivated before starting a task? Of course you have. We all have. By task, I mean anything you have planned to do or needs to be done—work, study, home chores, exercise, you name it.

There are many ways we try to manipulate the situation to get things done: a quick nap, more coffee, a motivational video. Just any external influence to use or blame will do. But ask yourself: how much time, resources, and energy are you wasting by watching videos, listening to podcasts, or psyching yourself up before doing this **EVERY SINGLE TIME**?

The drive that helps you finish the task should come from within. Here's why.

External aids aren't always accessible when you need them, and they don't work every time. You become dependent on them—a slave to those external influences. You act only when they're available. I once thought to myself: If I only go running when I feel like it (perfect conditions—not too hungry or full, sunny but not too hot or cold, not raining, motivated, energized), I'd run maybe twice a year.

But I found a better way. Here's the approach that revolutionized how I get things done.

## The New Approach: Actions Over Feelings

Let's say your task is to run. To run, you simply: get dressed, go to your starting point, move your legs, and finish.

**THAT'S IT.**

You don't need to be motivated, sad, or happy to finish the task. You don't need to read a chapter to boost yourself up, listen to your favorite podcast, or watch a motivational video. Those things are actually a waste of time.

Here's the truth: **NONE of your tasks care about your feelings, mental state, or energy levels.** Whether you're tired or excited, happy or sad, motivated or lazy—it doesn't matter.

**Getting things done is simply performing a sequence of actions. Your feelings are irrelevant.**

To exaggerate a bit: Imagine you need to wash a glass. Do you need to read a book about washing glasses, watch a motivational video about washing glasses, or be motivated to wash it? No. You stand up, go to the sink, take the glass, wash it, put it to dry. Done. The same goes for any other task.

I've found this approach effective with every single task I've encountered. Whenever I feel lazy, unmotivated, or tired, I just remember how irrelevant those feelings are. Easier said than done at first, but with practice it becomes second nature.

## Conclusion

The next time you catch yourself procrastinating for whatever reason, stop. Don't wait for motivation to strike. The task doesn't care how you feel. You'll be surprised how quickly momentum builds once you stop negotiating with yourself and just start.

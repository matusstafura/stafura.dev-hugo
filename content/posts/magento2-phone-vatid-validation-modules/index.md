# 🛡️ Boost Your Magento 2 Store with Free Phone & VAT ID Validation Modules

Magento 2 allows almost anything in checkout fields — and that’s a problem.

Bad phone numbers or invalid VAT IDs can break shipping labels, invoicing, or even tax logic. To fix this, I built and released two free and lightweight validation modules that you can drop into any Magento 2 store.

## 📞 Phone Number Validation

Out of the box, Magento doesn’t validate phone numbers beyond “not empty.”

### What this module does:
- ✅ Adds a **digits-only** validation rule to phone fields
- 🛒 Works in checkout, customer account forms, and more
- ⚙️ Toggle validation per store in the Magento admin

### Why it matters:
- Prevents typos like `(abc)---`
- Helps with better logistics integration
- Cleaner customer data

## 🧾 VAT ID Validation (All EU Formats)

Let’s face it: customers often enter **wrong VAT IDs** — which could mean failed B2B transactions or tax miscalculations.

This module adds **smart validation per EU country** (based on regex).

### Features:
- 🎯 Validates country-specific VAT format based on selection (e.g. `SK1234567890`, `DE123456789`)
- 🌍 Supports **all EU member states**
- 🌐 Fully translatable via `i18n/*.csv`
- ⚙️ Frontend validation, non-blocking

## 💡 Why Use These?

- ✔️ Zero performance hit (JS-based)
- ✔️ Modular and clean
- ✔️ Fully open-source under MIT
- ✔️ Works with Magento 2.4.x and up

Both modules are available on **Packagist** and can be installed via Composer. No hacks. No core changes.

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

I’m planning to add optional backend validation for stores that need stricter control beyond frontend checks. I’m also considering support for custom regex patterns per store view, giving merchants more flexibility. Lastly, I’d like to improve the admin experience with better previews and testing tools to verify validation rules before going live.

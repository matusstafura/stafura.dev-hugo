**"Big things have small beginnings."**  
— _Lawrence of Arabia_

When Quentin Tarantino became famous, he was asked how he made his first movie, which turned out to be an instant classic and international hit.

He explained that _Reservoir Dogs_ was not actually his first film.

Before that, he made a short movie (_My Best Friend's Birthday_), which wasn’t great. However,

> ... it gave him experience with every stage of the filmmaking process.

He wasn’t focused on fame or press at the time. Even though he gave it his all, quality wasn’t the priority.

Tarantino moved from simply dreaming about making movies to hiring actors, learning about sets, working with people, writing scripts, managing budgets, promoting films, and most importantly, finishing the project.

Once he gained that experience, he was better equipped to focus on directing and managing his next project. This allowed him to predict challenges, visualize outcomes, create schedules, and oversee the process more effectively.

No matter how big or complex your goal is, start with a smaller version of it. This is especially true if you plan to dedicate your life to similar projects. By starting small, you minimize risks and avoid wasting resources.

For example, if you want to publish a book, write an article first.

The process will teach you: the discipline of sitting still and writing every day, the tools you need (typewriter, computer, pen, or paper), the skills you may lack (grammar, vocabulary, style), and even the dull tasks like research and editing. It will also give you insights into promoting your work, whether online or offline.

## Keys To Remember

- Start with smaller versions of your projects before scaling up.
- Focus on the process and leave quality standards for the bigger goal.

If you aim to run a marathon, start by running a single mile.

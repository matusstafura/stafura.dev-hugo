While mastery can apply to any profession, in this post I will focus on its significance in programming and development.

Becoming the best version of yourself isn’t easy. However, the key consideration is this: if you’re willing to invest several years of your life in learning to become a master, the knowledge and rewards you gain will benefit you for the rest of your life.

Mastery isn’t just about sitting endless hours in front of a computer. It affects every aspect of your life—discipline, health, communication, and more.

## Reasons to become a Master

### Money

I am not judging but if money is your motivation, then why not. Specialists are paid exceptionally well for their expertise.

### Reputation

Even more valuable than money is the reputation that comes with mastery. It opens doors to opportunities: exciting projects, networking with fascinating people, traveling, and more. These are things that remain out of reach for many.

### Offers

When you’re a master, job offers are no longer a concern. You won’t even need to apply; companies will seek you out for your skills.

Large companies would rather pay well for a master than hire multiple mediocre individuals.

### Poetry

You write code that is a joy to read, a masterpiece studied by others.

### Simplicity

You write clean, easy-to-understand code that anyone can maintain with ease.

### Speed

What takes you days today will take only hours as a master. Your experience enables you to write code so quickly that you’ll wish you could type faster the code you already wrote in your head.

### Foresight

You’ll anticipate potential problems in advance, designing software that’s easy for your colleagues to implement. From testing and metrics to debugging and logging, you’ll have it all covered.

## Final words

What do you want to do instead? Mediocre people have a harder time getting employed because there are too many of them. They are also the first ones to be fired.

Thus, becoming a master isn’t just a matter of preference—it’s a necessity.

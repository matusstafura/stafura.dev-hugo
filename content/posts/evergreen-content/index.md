### What does research say

- According to a study by the Nielsen Norman Group, users spend an average of 10-20 seconds on a web page before deciding whether to stay or leave. This means that you have a very short amount of time to engage your readers and convince them to stay on your page. If your content is written solely for robots and is dry and unengaging, users are likely to leave your page quickly. {{< link title="Nielsen Norman Group study" url="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/" >}}

- Google's algorithm has evolved to prioritize content that is high-quality and provides value to users. In its Quality Rater Guidelines, Google states that "high-quality content is the most important factor in determining a page's quality rating". This means that if you're creating content solely for robots and not for humans, your content is unlikely to rank well in search results. {{< link title="Google Quality Rater Guidelines" url="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-quality/evaluating-your-own-content" >}}

### Example

### Benefits of writing evergreen content

- **Longevity**: Evergreen content doesn't have an expiration date. It continues to serve its purpose, attracting visitors and providing useful information for years to come.

- **Return on investment**: Due to its long-lasting nature, evergreen content primarily requires a one-time investment in terms of time and effort. Compare this with non-evergreen content, which can quickly become obsolete, and the cost advantage is clear.

- **Increased authority**: When your content is consistently referred to and linked by other websites, your website's authority grows. This, in turn, improves your visibility in search results and drives more traffic to your website.

- **Consistently drives traffic:** As it always remains relevant, evergreen content attracts new readers and is discovered through search engines, resulting in an ongoing flow of traffic to your site. People continue to share these valuable articles, thus increasing your readership even more.

- **Requires minimal updates:** With an evergreen focus, your articles require fewer updates, saving you time and effort. This enables you to concentrate on creating new content and expanding your online presence.

- **Supports SEO efforts:** Since search engines prioritize relevant, high-quality content, evergreen articles naturally surge ahead in search rankings. This organic improvement in SEO allows your articles to be easily discovered by potential readers.

### How can you create evergreen content

- Start by analyzing your target audience's needs and identifying the topics that will remain relevant over time. 

- Focus on creating comprehensive, well-structured articles that cover these topics in-depth. 

- Generalize the information and remove any specific data.

- Rewrite the article while considering its relevance for years ahead, even a decade from now.

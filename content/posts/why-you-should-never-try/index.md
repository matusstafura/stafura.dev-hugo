> Don't try. -- Charles Bukowski

Years ago, I read about a lecture given by a professional therapist to a group of students.[1] During the session, while interacting with the audience, the therapist he noticed one of students expressing willingness to try something. But it did not work. In other words the student's attempt never materialized into action.

"Come here. I want to show you something," therapist said. The student approached the stage and sat down.

Therapist: "Do you see the glass of water on the table in front of you?"

Student replied: "Yes."

Therapist: "Try to pick it up?"

The student leaned forward, and just as he tried to grab the glass, therapist said: "Do not pick it up, just ***try*** to pick it up."

The student froze somewhat in the middle, attempting but never actually touching the glass. 

Like in the painting [Touch of God](https://www.google.com/search?q=touch+of+god). 

So, when you thing about trying to start a project, try new food, or attemptiong anything else, you may never actually do it.

## Key to remember

Trying is not doing. You either commit to completing the task or discard it entirely and immediately.

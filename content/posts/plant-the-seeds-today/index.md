Another year has passed, and it's time for reflection. This year was far better than the one before—not because of what I did in recent months, but because of the work I put in years ago. I'm talking about seeds that grow on their own, even while I sleep. Far from perfect, but nurtured over time, they’ve transformed into plants and trees.

The problem with having a job is that you only get paid for the hours you work.  
Your earnings are limited to your active time. And what happens if you lose your job tomorrow? Cultivating your own "garden" is essential. If you neglect it, nothing meaningful will grow. But if you take the time to clear out the weeds and plant tiny seeds, you’ll eventually enjoy not just the fruit they bear, but also the knowledge, discipline, and independence they bring.

### MVP

I believe the main issue for people who _want_ to build and create but _don’t_ is impatience. They want quick profits. Secondly, they’re overwhelmed by the scope of the project. They worry about the information, tools, and money they think they need at the start.

> In business, there's a concept called the [Minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) or MVP.

MVPs can help overcome these challenges:

- minimum costs
- cheap to build
- minimum time to maintain 
- information gathering

### Ideas

In the first phase, do not worry about perfection or profit. Just have it done with minimal setup.

Here are a few ideas to inspire you:

- **Literally plant seeds**: Buy soil, a tray, and some pea seeds. This costs just a few bucks and takes a few minutes. Within days, you’ll have a crop. A few months later, you could scale up to a full rig for personal use or sell your fresh produce to a local restaurant.
- **Sell a product**: Either create your first product or resell an existing one for a profit.
- **If you have a garden, get two chickens**: One chicken would be lonely :)
- **Start a blog**: Publish one post about your expertise.
- **Upload a video**: Share a hobby or skill in one video.

The idea is to create projects that deliver results even while you sleep—like plants growing, products selling, chickens laying eggs, readers engaging with your posts, or subscriptions rolling in.
### Keys To Remember

In 365 days, you’ll reflect on the year. The last thing you want is to look back and realize you’ve sown no seeds and have no fruits to harvest.

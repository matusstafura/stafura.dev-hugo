Hello! I'm **Matus Stafura**, a developer, SEO specialist, and marketing strategist from Slovakia. 

Over the years, I've assisted numerous websites in enhancing their Google rankings, boosting their traffic, and augmenting their brand awareness through effective marketing strategies. 

My passion lies in open-source software, SEO, privacy, and best practices. I strive for performance, idiomatic code, and an optimal experience for both users and developers. 

In addition to my work, I enjoy writing articles on software development and marketing, sharing my knowledge and insights with a wider audience.

When it comes to programming, my tools of choice include PHP, Go, Javascript/Typescript, TailwindCSS, bash, neovim, and tmux.

I have a keen interest in programming, SEO, and marketing, and I'm always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.

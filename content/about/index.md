## About

![avatar](/images/about/avatar.png)

Hello! I'm a developer and strategist from Slovakia. Most of my time is spent at Megamix of which I'm the co-owner.

Over the past 15 years, I've helped numerous companies increase their traffic, optimize software, and improve programming, resulting in enhanced brand awareness and significant growth in revenue.

In addition to my work, I enjoy writing articles on software development and marketing on [https://dev.to/matusstafura](https://dev.to/matusstafura), sharing my knowledge and insights with a wider audience.

When it comes to programming, my tools of choice include Ubuntu, PHP, Go, bash, neovim, and tmux.
